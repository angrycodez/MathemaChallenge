Install:
#Requirements
sudo apt install nodejs
(since this installed old version 10.19, use this command instead to get most recent version of nodejs:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs)

sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install ng-common

#angular cli
npm install - g @angular/cli

# create new project
ng new MathemaChallange

# run server
ng serve -o --poll=2000

# create new component
ng generate component color_slider


Process:
-Setup empty project
-get debugger running
-create color bar (new component, color array, html elements, css styling)
-draw and add image to show slider arrow
-catch mouse events on component
-compute event position in component and transform to corresponding color
-create field to preview the selected color
-invert selected color to print the color value nicely readable
-create button for random color_slider setup (set random colors and random weights)
-write test cases (i know, probably should have done that earlier/step by step during the process, but was too busy to actually getting used to angular and all the environment)


Result:
-created freely usable angular component to display a color-bar with a slider to select a color
-the content of the color-bar can be freely adjusted by setting an array for the color-values and one for the color_weight-values


Known Issues:
-when clicking on the arrow for sliding, the image is getting dragged, and the slider doesn't move smoothly. when releasing the mouseButton, the drag-state keeps active
-the layout for the 'randomize colors'-button is not working properly; it's rather lucky that the position fits the component quite well
